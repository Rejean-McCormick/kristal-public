# C3 repository update — verification report (2026-10-12)

## Input and status

- Source: supplied `Code_snapshot_kristal-public(1).zip`; status limited to that archive, **not** GitHub remote HEAD.
- Planning source: supplied `Kristal_v10_Plan_Harmonisation_2026-10-12(1).zip`, `repos/05_kristal-public.md` (C3-01..C3-06).
- Changes apply to the standalone `kristal-public` **source**. This package is a local candidate for integration review and does not publish anything.

## Execution evidence

| Check | Outcome | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` | **19/19 PASS** | Safe local fixture regression tests; not C1/C2 or full E2E qualification |
| Framework draft.3.1 JS `verify-node-v10` | **PASS** | Existing node descriptor structurally accepted |
| Framework draft.3.1 JS `verify-github-binding-v10` | **PASS** | Existing host binding structurally accepted |
| Framework draft.3.1 JS `verify-state-v9` on root and Zoology | **PASS, both** | Their existing logical State Commitments structurally validate; not factual correctness |
| `python tools/c3_collection.py --repo . scan` | **BLOCKED** | `kristals/index.json` absent; expected fail-closed result |
| `python tools/repository_audit.py --repo .` | **BLOCKED / DRIFT** | All five Bootstrap-managed SHA records disagree with supplied current bytes |
| C1 independent qualification + C2 public authorization | **NOT VERIFIED** | Must be proved externally for the exact revision and scope |
| Real v10 hosted read-surface synchronization | **NOT PERFORMED** | Missing actual Manager-generated Zoology manifest and AI entrypoint |

## Compatibility and ownership

- **C3-01:** original publication workflow remains `contents: read` and always exits blocked. Neither it nor the managed qualify workflow was edited.
- **C3-02:** did **not** fabricate missing `kristals/index.json`, `kristals/zoology/.kristal/sync-manifest.json` or reader files. A genuinely sourced staging ingestion is documented.
- **C3-03:** Bootstrap-managed hash drift was detected, **not** auto-fixed. Framework pins are documented for owner review; no guessed SHA changes.
- **C3-04:** local validator and tests hardened; this does not replace Framework v9 structural validation or independent C1.
- **C3-05:** added a separate read-only fixtures CI job. Branch protection and trusted C1/C2 gates require GitHub account-owner work outside the repository.
- **C3-06:** README and docs distinguish structural PASS from authorized public publication.

## Files protected from changes

`.kristal/node.json`, `.kristal/bindings/github.json`, `.kristal/capabilities.json`, `.kristal/bootstrap-state.json`, `state/state-snapshot.json`, `kristals/zoology/state/state-snapshot.json`, `.github/workflows/kristal-qualify.yml`, `.github/workflows/kristal-publish.yml`.

## Outstanding blockers (before any public write)

1. Approved immutable Framework commit/compatibility lock and checked CLI (F-01/B-01).
2. Complete and trusted Manager runtime; Kit-generated, ready Zoology read surface, Manager sync-manifest and index (M-01/M-03/C3-02).
3. Bootstrap-managed-file ownership reconciliation, with no silent adoption/overwrite (B-01/C3-03).
4. Real independent C1 qualification and separate revocable C2 approval **before public sync**, plus secured GitHub rulesets/Environments (D-01/B-02/M-02/C3-05).
5. Qualified immutable C3 publication/release and separately authorized C4 reader intake (C3-01/C3-06).

## Recommended safe integration

Review the diff against **actual remote HEAD** and account-level GitHub policy. Keep Bootstrap-managed workflows untouched unless C0/C2 authorizes reconciliation. Merge source-only changes with minimal privileges. Do not mark the hosted collection green or create a public release just because the new unit tests pass.

## Additional fail-closed safeguard

The inherited `GitSink.bat` script formerly staged **all** repository files, committed them, and immediately pushed them on execution. This is unsafe for a public collection while C1/C2 authorization is unverified. The updated `GitSink.bat` exits `BLOCKED` without staging, committing, or pushing; publication must use an approved gated process. This file was **not** Bootstrap-managed. The obsolete `SMARTDUMP_INDEX.txt` (a transport ZIP index) is not shipped as if it were an accurate source-tree inventory.
