# Immutable C3 publication — implementation and qualification plan

**Not implemented in this update.** Signing/verification of local C1/C2 receipts is an independent prerequisite; passing those local checks is **not** a publishing permission.

## C3 release contract to ratify with C0/C1/C2

- Exact approved Git commit and repository identity; no branch-tip alias at verification time.
- Exactly one target slug with a manifest-bound `state_ref`, v9 logical commitment, canonical C3 `index_digest` and `surface_digest`.
- Exact content archive SHA-256, length and allowlisted paths; no additional files, no symlinks, no secrets, no external materialization without explicit validation.
- Trusted C1 qualification and C2 authorization receipts with exact scope, current revocation state, license/privacy approval and the intended destination already approved **before** any public write.
- Creation in trusted private runner only, isolated from repository-controlled candidate scripts; GitHub tags locked/protected, release asset hash independently checked after upload.
- Signed and timestamped immutable publication receipt binding tag, tag object/commit, artifact SHA-256 and origin commit; no overwrite/upsert or silent tag move.
- C4 read-only intake checks issuer, commit, hash and immutable receipt, maintains last good public release, and rejects revocations or mismatched assets.
- Separate activation switch and rollback of **consumer pointers**; the historical release is not deleted or rewritten to simulate rollback.

## Qualification tests still required

- Reject unsigned/revoked/mismatched C1 or C2.
- Reject content or membership drift after approval; pending approval cannot apply to a different Git commit or index.
- Reject direct public pushes that bypass the externally controlled staging gate.
- Reject tag re-pointing, release overwrite, missing/invalid attestation, wrong artifact bytes and authorization after first public exposure.
- Simulate upload interruption, publish/verify interruption, consumer failure and revoked activation. Verify no unauthorized public bytes became visible and the prior consumer pointer is preserved.

No GitHub release, tag, file push, or public access change is performed by this repository package. The existing managed workflows remain sealed pending owner-approved reconciliation.
